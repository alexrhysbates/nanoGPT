This one goes to all the disciples
Out there on the journey that we call life
You know there's only 5 needs
And Kyle and I have compiled 'em
And awoken them into song
A song that we like to call "The 5 Needs"

First you need the planet
Earth beneath your feet
You couldn't live an instant without that
Then you need the air
Oxygen to breathe
You couldn't live five minutes without that
Then you need the water
The icy cold water
Now, you need some love (love)
You need some love (love)
We only wanted to rock your world (We hoped that we rocked your world)
The fifth need is to rock your world (We really wanna rock your world)
It comes before food!
Ohhh
Liga Guing
Well, I can't get to sleep tonight
No matter how hard I try
'Cause it's cold and it's dark
And the wind is a-whistling
And I can't seem to put out the light
Mama's been searching for baby
But baby been tryin' to get home
'Cause it's cold and it's dark
And the moon cannot light the way
And Daddy's gone (Bye-bye)
I'm just a baby
I've had this birthmark since I was born
It's the name of our fuckin' band, dude
I have ass-mark too

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Because

My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Girl, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not thе way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tеll me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Because

My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

B-baby baby b-baby baby one more time
Hit me oh yeah
B-baby baby b-baby baby one more time
Hit me oh yeah
Hit me baby but not so hard
Hit me one more time
Hit me baby but not too hard
One more time again

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And I must confess that my loneliness is killin' me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time
My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

KG: So much, so much
Terminator: Wait, wait. Before you go, I got this song I want to sing


All you people up there in City Hall
You're fucking it up for the people that's in the streets
This is a song for the people in the streets, not the people City Hall
All you motherfuckers in the streets, it's time to rise up
Come along children and fucking rise

Lots of times when me and KG are watching
All the fucking shit that goes down at City Hall
We get the feeling we should fuck shit up
Yeah, we should fucking start a riot
A riot!

We have 'em screaming in the streets
We have tipping over shit and breaking fucking windows of small businesses
And settin' fuckin' fires
And settin' fuckin' fires
And settin' fuckin' fires
And then after the smoke has cleared
And the rubble has been swept away
Me and KG will peek out our heads
We've been watching the riots on a monitor
Twenty floors below sea level
From a bunker
We did it Rage-Kage
We beat the bastards of City Hall
Maniacal laughter
But now what will we do? We must rebuild
But who will lead us in the rebuilding process?
Man, it's got to be someone with the know-how
And the elbow grease
To lead us to a new land
No, not me and KG
We don't have the cognitive capacity to lead
Alright, we'll do it!
We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
Ah-aaahh
(We'll lead as Two Kings)
Haa-aah
We'll lead as Two Kings

The first decree
Is to legalize marijuana
The tyranny and the bullshit's gone on too long
You old fucking shrivs
Who blocked its legalization
You're banished from the land!

We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
A-haaaaaaa
(We'll lead as Two Kings)
Ha-ah, ah-a
Lead as Two Kings

The second decree
No more pollution
No more car exhaust
Or ocean dumpage
From now on we will travel in tubes
We'll lead as Two Kings, oh, yeah
We'll fucking lead as Two Kings
Get the scientists working
On the tube technology immediately
(Tube technology)
Chop, chop, let's go

Third decree
No more
Rich people
And poor people
From now on
We will all be the same
Umm... I don't know
I gotta think about that

We'll lead as Two Kings
Ah-yah-ah-ha-ha
Ah-yah-ah-ha-hah
Ha-ha-ho-hee
Ho-ha-ho-hee
Ha-ha-ho-hoh
Oh my God
(Ahh... What)
Dude, the red phone is flashing
(Oh, yeah)
Let me scoop that up
Hello? Two Kings
(Who is it)
What? No! No fucking way
(What)
Rage, there's a potato famine in Idaho
You gotta go down there
(Oh my God... What?)
Dude, I gotta stay here
(Why do I have to go?)
Please! Please
(Oh, God, okay, fine)
Awesome... Is he gone?
Alright, emergency meeting of Parliament
Alright, Parliament, I know this is fucked up
But, Rage, he can't be King anymore
Dudes, he's encroaching on my decrees
Seriously, let's make him Duke
Like a kickass Duke
Or "Leader Formerly Known as King"
But, uh-oh, he's coming back

We'll lead as Two Kings, oh yes
We'll really lead as Two Kings

(Uh, dude)
Rage
(I went all over Idaho)
Yeah?
(Uh, plenty of potatoes everywhere)
What? There was no famine
(Yeah, there was no famine, no)
Dude
(I don't know what's uh...)
A toast...
(A toast?)
Long live The D
(Alright, long live The D)
Clinking of glasses
Long live me!
I'm sorry, I poisoned your wine
(What?)
For the good of the land
(You poi-?
I poisoned yours, haha, as well)
Noooooo!
No

City, city, city, city, city, city, shitty
Shitty, city, shitty, shitty, city, city, shitty
Hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall

People inside me are asking me to smoke up City Hall
'Cause no one here is talking
People inside me are asking me to blow up City Hall
'Cause no one here is rockin'
People inside me are asking me to blow up City Hall
'Cause everyone is Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots
Everyone is Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots
Everyone is Rock 'Em Sock 'Em – Go! Oh!

Malibu, makin' a poo
Stinky poo, lookin' at you
Because it's time for my breakfast, it's time for some cheese
It's time for the stink, time for the breeze
Time for the, ha-leeeeee
All you people up there in City Hall
You're fuckin' it up for the people that's in the streets
This is a song for the people in the streets
Not the people City Hall
All you motherfuckers in the streets it's time to rise up, up up up
Come along children and fuckin' rise!
Lots of times when me and KG are watchin'
All the fuckin' shit that goes down at City Hall
We get the feeling we should fuck shit up
Yeah we should fuckin' start a riot
A Riot!
We have 'em screaming in the streets
We have 'em tippin' over shit and breakin' fuckin' windows of small businesses
And settin' fuckin' fires!
And settin' fuckin' fires!
And settin' fuckin' fires!

And then after the smoke is cleared
And the rubble has been swept away
Me and KG will peek out our heads
We've been watching the riots on a monitor twenty floors below sea level
From a bunker
We did it Rage-Kage, we beat the bastards of City Hall!
 But now what will we do?
We must rebuild. But who will lead us in the rebuilding process?
Man, it's got to be someone with the know-how
And the elbow grease to lead us to a new land
No, not me and KG, we don't have the cognitive capacity to lead...
Alright, we'll do it!

We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
Ahhhaaa (Two Kings, we'll lead as Two Kings)
Ah-ha ah-how
We'll lead as Two Kings

The first decree is to legalize marijuana
The tyranny and the bullshit's gone on too long
You old fuckin' shrivs who blocked it's legalization
You're banished from the land!

We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
Ahhhaaa (Two Kings, we'll lead as Two Kings)
Ah-ha ah-how
Lead as Two Kings

The second decree: no more pollution, no more car exhaust
Or ocean dumpage. From now on, we will travel in tubes!

We'll lead as Two Kings, oh, yeah
We'll fuckin' lead as Two Kings

Get the scientists working on the tube technology, immediately
(Tube technology.) Chop, chop, let's go

Third decree: no more... rich people: and poor people
From now on, we will all be the same... ummm, I dunno
I gotta think about that...

We'll lead as Two Kings
Ah yeah, ah yeahhhahahaha
Ha-ha-ho-hee, ha-ha-ho-hee-ha-ha-ho-ho-ho-ho

 Oh my God
 Ahh... What?
 Dude, the red phone is flashing
 Oh, yeah

 Rage, there's a potato famine in Idaho, you gotta go down there!
 Oh my God... what?
 Dude, I gotta stay here!
 Why do I have to go?
 Please! Please!
 Oh, God, okay
 Awesome... is he gone? Alright, emergency meeting of Parliament
All right Parliament, I know this is fucked up
But Rage, he can't be King anymore
Dudes, he's encroaching on my decrees!
Seriously, let's make him "Duke," a kick ass "Duke."
Or "leader formerly known as King," but-- uh-oh he's comin' back...

We'll lead as Two Kings, oh yes
We'll really lead as Two Kings

 Uh, dude?
 Rage
 I went all over Idaho...
 Yeah?
 Uh, plenty of potatoes everywhere
 What? There was no famine?
 Yeah, there was no famine, no
 Dude
 I don't know what's uh...
 A toast...
 A toast...
 Long live the "D."
 Long live the "D."

 Long live me. I'm sorry, I poisoned your wine
 What?
 For the good of the land
 You p-- I poisoned yours... huh heh, as well
 Noooooooooo!!!!!

City, city, city, city, city, city, shitty
Shitty, city, shitty, shitty, city, city, shitty
Hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall
People inside me are askin' me to smoke up City Hall
'Cause no one here is talkin'
People inside me are askin' me to blow up City Hall
'Cause no one here is rockin'
People inside me are askin' me to blow up City Hall
'Cause everyone is Rock-'em Sock-'em Robots
Everyone is Rock-'em Sock-'em Robots
Everyone is Rock-'em Sock-'em GO! OH!

 Um, do you believe in God?

Malibu Nights

 I got some lyrics

Malibu nights, tangerine dreams
Malibu neighs, Malibu dreams

Hey Kage
Jabels
How goes it man?
It's good, it's good
You know I've been thinkin' a lot about it
And um, I just want us to be the best fuckin' band in the world
Well, yeah, me too
I mean, there's no point in doin' it if we're not the best
Well, it's true, I agree with that
I mean what, what, we're gonna be, yeah we're really good
We're almost as good as Arcade Fire, fuck that
Yeah
We gotta leave those fuckers in the dust
What, what do you mean?
All those fuckin' youngsters gotta lick our boot or fuck it
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, well how do we do that though?
Dude, you need to fuckin' have some lessons
What?!
You know you're really good, but you gotta expand your game
Lessons?
You know how Kobe, in the off-season, will go and like
Learn a fuckin', you know, a Texas-two-step or somethin'
To add to his arsenal?
Yeah, that's true, that's true
Well I've just been noticing
Some of your classic riffs are a little sloppy
Really? Huh
And I, I hope you're not pissed off at me
But I went and hired a dude
Yeah?
Yeah
Oh no, what?
Dude, just give it a chance will you?
If you don't like, hey, I swear, if you don't like it
We'll fuckin' fire his ass, he's out
Who is this guy? I've never
His name is Felix Char
Oh, what?
He's from Spain and he is the best

KG: Do you think that um, do you think that when the album, when this is out...

JB: Yeah, I been doin' cock push-ups
KG: Cock push-ups?

KG: No, that's, that'd be impossible, your cock can support your whole weight?
JB: Well not at first
KG: Yeah?
JB: But over time
KG: Hmm, how, how many push-ups can you do?
JB: Cock push-ups?
KG: Yeah... I guess you could only do one really
JB: Yeah, well one is all ya need

What was I thinking?
All this rage, it's the end of the world
Spreading my hatred
I must sound insane to every boy and every girl

Colors are the thing that make the world better
I've been seeing things in black and white
If we work together we can live forever
If we do it right tonight

Look at our oceans, whales have gone away
Corporations ran amok
Look at our planet, now just shades of grey
No one seems to give a fuck

And colors are the thing that make the world better
I've been seeing things in black and white
If we work together we can live forever
If we do it right tonight

'Cause colors are the thing that make the world better
I've been seeing things in black and white
If we work together we can live forever
If we do it right tonight
'Cause fucking once again we'll call, fucking
Every time you mothertrucking
And one last time, you're going to fucking die

(Spoken)
It's an honor to introduce a close friend of Ricky Bobby: Will Ferrell!
WILL
(Sung)
A comedian at the Oscars'
The saddest man of all
Your movies may make millions
But your name they'll never call
I guess you don't like laughter
And a smile brings you down
A comedian at the Oscars
Is the saddest, bitterest, alcoholic clown
(Spoken)
Jack Black!
JACK
Will Ferrell!
(Sung)
What did you think when
You took off your pants
And you ran around that racetrack
And did that silly dance?
What did you think?
WILL
I thought they'd love me
JACK
What, did you think that
You could change their wicked game?
Did you think when you made Anchorman
They wouldn't call it lame?
What did you think?
WILL
I thought I'd get to have dinner
With Jeremy Irons
JACK
We may not win tonight
But we shall win the ultimate fight
(Spoken)
And I'm not speaking in a metaphor, I mean literally! I am going to fight the nominees!
WILL
I like the way you're talking! I'm sick of this crap!
JACK
Hey!  Leo! You think you can date supermodels and win awards? I'm going to elbow you in the Larynx!
WILL
Ryan Gosling, you're all hip and now. Well I'm going to break your hip, right now!
JACK
Hey, Peter O'Toole! You're all legendary in English, I don't care. I'm going to beat you down with my Nickelodeon Award!
WILL
Mark Wahlberg! Where are you!? I won't mess with you, you're actually kind of badass. (Beat) Once again, I hope we're cool. You are very talented
JACK
And Helen Mirren? You are just hot. What party are you going to?
JOHN
Fellas! Fellas!
WILL
Jack Black! Look, John C. Reilly!
JOHN
(Sung)
This madness must stop
There is no need to fear
You can have your cake and eat it, too
Just look at my career
I didn't cry the blues
I didn't pick silly fights
I chose to be in Boogie and
Talladega Nights!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
So, don't just be clowns
'Cause then you're disposed
Mix it up and Oscars
Shall! Be! Yours!
JACK
(Spoken)
He's right. I'm going to re-read that script about the guy who gets lead poisoning, and sues a major corporation. There's not a laugh in there!
JOHN
Yes!
WILL
And I'm going to take that project about the guy with no arms and legs who teaches gang-bangers Hamlet!
JOHN
Now you're talking!
WILL
(Sung)
I'm going to lose 40 pounds
To play Ralph Nader
JACK
I'm going to do that gig of mine
And film with James Spader
WILL
(Spoken)
Oh, I love him!
ALL
(Sung)
So, Anthony Hopkins, you can laugh
But someday soon, you'll see
Helen Mirren and an Oscar
Will be coming home with me!
With me!
Helen Mirren will be coming home with me!

They must pay the rent
With their rock
The world is fucking turning to shit
The earth don't stand a chance
Hurricane typhoon will destroy the city
We've got to clean up the skies and recycle
We've got to stop the overpopulation
But most important of all
We've got to build a Deth Starr
Deth Starr, it's a fuckin' ship
It's a son of a bitch, y'all, and we're building it
It's gonna take us up into the sky
We don't need the earth, we're gonna fuckin' fly sky high
Deth Starr is a son of a bitch, y'all
Gonna take us into outer space
Get your shit together, motherfucker
We're gonna start a new human race in the sky
In the sky
You know we will be rockin' on the Deth Starr
Solar eclipse of the sky
Everybody goin' insane
Futuristic video games
Everybody have a good time
Synthesizing water to wine
But how? How?
I hired a nerd
I fuckin' paid a nerd
It is absurd, but I paid him to build it
'Cause I don't know how to build that ship, that's right
There's a vacuum in space
It fuckin' sucks your face
Day or night, you gots to make it airtight
You gotta build that ship, make it out of sight
The fuckin' Deth Starr
You know we will be rockin' on the Deth Starr
We will be Democratic on the Deth Starr
There will be lots of votin' on the Starr
Havin' lots of sex with my friends
Dipping candle into rear-ends
Bonin' on a virtual plane
Fuckin' till I'm fuckin' insane, oh
Oh, yeah yeah yeah, right there (Oh)
Bend over that space module (Oh yeah)
Oh, zero gravity fucking (Oh yeah)
Hey look, there's Uranus! (Oh that shit is tight)
We got to build more Starrs
We got to spread out far
Seven strong, we gots to bang a gong
But baby, hold up for now, there's something wrong
What's that?
That's a fuckin' squid
An evil alien squid
Join up ships, we got to let it rips
We got to blow that bitch to another dimension
Deth Starr
We got to build a hundred of 'em
Deth Starr
We spread across the galaxy
Deth Starr
You know we will be rockin' on the Starr
Deth Starr
We gotta build a million of 'em
Deth Starr
We're spread across the galaxy
Deth Starr
We must divide and conquer on the Starr
Deth Starr
So we search the galaxy
For other forms of life
We got to drink their nutrients
To sustain high quality of life
So we scoop up the creatures
Then we put them in a geodesic dome
But the question arises, my friend
What have we become?
Deth Starr!

Dio has rocked for a long, long time
Now it's time for him to pass the torch
He has songs of wildebeests and angels
He has soared on the wings of a demon

It's time to pass the torch
You're too old to rock, no more rockin' for you
We're taking you to a home
But we will sing a song about you

And we will make sure
That you're very well taken care of
You'll tell us secrets that you've learned

Oh!
Your sauce will mix with ours
And we'll make a good goulash, baby
Dio, time to go
You must give your cape and scepter
To me, and a smaller one for KG

Go, go
Dio, Dio, oh

Lot of times, when the elders, they smile
An illusion, an infusion, an intrusion
An amusement park ride!

To the shores of ye old rustic shinock
Decimating the competition
Leaving in their wake, a blind ambition
Come along children, let's rock, get it on!

Friendship is rare
Do you know what I'm saying to you?
Friendship is rare, my derriere
When you find out much later that they don't really care

It's rare, to me
Can't you see?
It's rare, to me
Can't you see?

Oh shit, there's a bear
Could you hand me that shotgun, buddy, also that chair
We're fighting a bear
Now your life's in great danger and you don't even care

It's rare, to me
Can't you see?
It's rare, to me
Can't you see?

It's rare, to me
Say a prayer, for me
'Cause it's rare to be
In Tenacious D

As long as there's a record deal we'll always be friends
Long as there's a record deal we'll always be friends
Friends will be friends, they're running naked in the sand
Friends holding hands, they'll someday surely form a band

This is a song for the ladies
But fellas…listen closely

You don't always have to fuck her hard
In fact sometimes that's not right to do
Sometimes you've got to make some love
And fucking give her some smooches too
Sometimes you got to squeeze
Sometimes you got to say please
Sometime you got to say, hey

I'm gonna fuck you softly
I'm 'onna screw you gently
I'm 'onna hump you sweetly
I'm 'onna ball you discreetly

And then you say, "Hey I brought you flowers"
And then you say, "Wait a minute Sally
I think I got something in my teeth
Could you get it out for me?" That's fucking teamwork

What's your favorite posish?
That's cool with me, it's not my favorite but I'll do it for you
What's your favorite dish?
I'm not gonna cook it but I'll order it from Zanzibar
And then I'm 'onna love you completely
And then I'll fucking fuck you discreetly
And then I'll fucking bone you completely

But then I'm gonna fuck you hard!
Hard
How could I leave KG all alone?
(He's never coming home)
As I rocket into space to my new home
(He's up there with the stars)
He will survive is what I tell myself
(He doesn't wanna be here)
I'm probably gonna jam with Yo-Yo Ma
Fuckin' Yo-Yo Ma
(I'm stuck here)
And then I'm gonna eat some ice cream
(He's never coming home)
Then I'm gonna have some sex
(Eating cat food alone)
I think of KG on the Earth all alone
My orgasm will be tainted
(Having sex with myself)
Explosion of my load
As I jam with Yo-Yo Ma
(Fuck Yo-Yo Ma)
It feels so good, my pecker wood
(His pecker wood)
But a tiny part of me is left behind
(Is up there with the stars)

We should talk about the hard fucking though
The hard fucking?
Because I think it's a pretty common complaint
Yeah the ladies don't really like the hard fucking
You feel like you're giving 'em some extra juice
They're not into that
No, you think you're like oh, taken 'em to the limit
Maybe they are though, they're into that
You know what the test is? You just say get on top honey
You do what you like, and then sometimes she'll be fucking you really hard
It's like wait, wait you like that? You like that?
Slow down I'm gonna spurt! AHH UHH Sorry
You shouldn't have fucked me so hard
I wasn't very popular in high school, And here's what I figured out
It was because I needed it too much, I needed attention
I think I have a, a chromosome, The need-attention-chromosome
I know that some of you have it too
And its fuckin' tragic
Caused a lot of pain, early on
And this is a song about that
Everything sucked in high school
So I moved to the Miiiidlle Eeeast
I kicked ass with the Krishna
I took on their belief
Sista! A-Hari Krishna
A-Hari Hari, A-Fucking Hari
Now I'm back home now
Momma don't like me
Daddy don't recognize me
A Hari Hari
A-Hari Krishna, oh yeah!
A Fucking Hari
A Hariiiiiiiii

Sing me a song, you're a singer
Pass me the bong, you're a bringer of reefer
The Devil is never a maker
I think that he's coaching the Lakers

Now it's on and on and on
It's Tenacious D
I can see

This is a song called The History of Tenacious D
And it's not just a list of bullshit that we've done in the past
It's a chronicling of our rise — To power!

We ride with kings on mighty steeds across the Devil's plain
We've walked with Jesus and his cross
He did not die in vain — No!

We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2, even stopped a moving train
We've traveled through space, and time, my friends
To rock this house again — Rock!

We ride and we ride, and we'll never subside
And we'll ride 'til the planets collide
And if you say that we do not ride, I'll tan your fuckin' hide — Ride!

Kyle's fingers be silver — Jack's voice then be gold
But lest you think we're vain
We know you're all robots, and we don't care
Tenacious D — We reign!
We reign
Supreme
Oh God
Burrito Supreme
And a Chicken Supreme
And a Cutlass Supreme

We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2
Even stopped a moving train
We've traveled through space and time, my friends
To rock this house again — Rock!

Hope is a doggy
A sweet doggy
Standing next to a rose
A flower grows in the soil
There's still hope for life to exist
For us to survive
To thrive and survive
And find a way to live our lives
And live through this nuclear Holocaust
Let's get it on
How will we survive?
With a little luck
And patience
And know-how
And love
We will survive
The nuclear Holocaust
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We will survive
And we will thrive
Must stay alive and we will strive
To make it to the top of the mountain
There shall be dragons and there shall be gorgons
There shall be many beasts with no name
Our trusty doggy will be there to save the day
Hope will find a way
Hope will find a way
*Kage snoring*
JB: Oh my God… oh my God I've done it. Kage, come here I want you!
KG: What?! What?! God! I was sleepin', dude! What are you talkin' about?
JB: Oh, my god…
KG: What?
JB: I did it
KG: What'd you do?
JB: I've done it, I fucking did it
KG: What?
JB: The most powerful tool in singing technology since yodeling, dude. Oh my God, inward singing!
KG: What?
JB: Check it out, it's an invention and it makes nonstop rocking possible. Think about it, man! Rock singers are only rocking you half the time, the other time they're, they're, they're, they're breathing in, but not anymore, baby! Hahahahaha! Not with inward singing. Check it out!
*Singing* And then, I start some lyrics and you
*Inward Singing* Can't believe I'm singin'
*Singing* And I'm never fuckin' stoppin' and I'm
*Inward Singing* Always fuckin' singin' and you...
*Singing* Now you know that I will never
*Inward Singing* Stop the fuckin' singin'
*Singing* I'm like a fuckin' one-man band, I'm like a fuckin' one-man
*Inward Singing* Band!
JB: And I can sing like that all fuckin' night
KG: Wow. It wasn't really nonstop, though. There was a slight-
JB: Aah, shut up! It is nonstop! And the other thing is, that when I'm fuckin' singin' in, it sounds even BETTER than when I'm singin' out! Shut up! Fuck you! You fuckin' dick! Always naysaying everything I create! You piece of shit, you create something like inward singing! You fuckin' shit you, fuckin' sit in your tower...
*Kage laughing*
JB: ... and fuckin' nap... what's funny? You fuckin' bitch!
*Kage continues to laugh*
JB: Fuckin', fuck yeah, fuckin'… cock-ay-ass!
You're fired from the band
KG: Um, that won't be necessary, Jack
JB: Why?
KG: Well, I'm quitting
JB: What?
KG: I quit

We're talkin' baaa, ba ba ba
Baba, ba ba ba
Baaa, ba ba ba

I was sleeping
And right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up
From something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I dread
"I think I love you!"
(I think I love you)

This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know just how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself (Yes)
I'd hide it to myself (Shh)
And never talk about it (Shh)
And did not I go and shout it
When you walked into my room
"I think I love you!" yeah
(I think I love you)
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is madе of?
Though it worries me to say
I've nеver felt this way

I have to tell you somethin' I've been thinkin' for a long time but didn't have the courage to say: I think I love you. You know what? Scratch that! I do love you, but I'm gonna say "I think I love you," because I don't know if this is love, 'cause I've never felt this feeling before, and I think I'm going insane

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about
Hey

I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of? (Woah)
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of (Yes)
A love there is no cure for
(I think I'm goin' crazy)
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I never felt this way

Believe me
You really don't have to worry
I only want to make you happy
And if you say "Hey, go away", I will
But I think better still
I better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face

Do you think you love me?
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
Laughter

Well, for a while it's late
So take another drink
Another pour
From my pocket ass whiskey, child!
All right!

Well, in the summertime, it's late

To be a famous one to date - Alright, stop, go again
Well, in the summertime, it's late
Is it the real thing?

Well, this is where it fucking comes from, we'll fucking come in there now, and talk about it later...
Well, in the summertime, it's late
To be a famous one to date
Is it the real thing?
God, it's the read thing!
Wo! The real thing!
KG and me were a rock and roll band to see!
From the old school woman that you might to just have to disagree
But when we rock upon the mic and we come up with a riff or three
It's late, but not too late
Wa! Wa wa wa wa oh uh!

Don't masturbate, just cause it's late
Oh oh oh uh!
Ten thousands suits couldn't stop us now when we blast through!
Oooh! Oh ho ho ha! Oh ahhh! wahh-ha-a!

KG: Wait, wait
Scientist: I fucking shoot you now!
KG: No! Is there no room for two?
Scientist: You fucking, you fucking savage!
KG: No, c'mon! We're a pair- team, we go together
JB: Dude! Fuck! This fucking sucks! He wants me, but not you? That's fucking bullshit!
KG: Wait, why would he just want one of us?
JB: Dude! Let me tell you something, let me tell you something right now
KG: Yeah, yeah?
JB: Fuck that guy. I'm gonna go, but here's-
KG: What!? You're gonna go?
JB: Now let me just tell you, let me tell you why I'm gonna go
KG: And leave me down here? What am I supposed to do? With a fucking three-headed dog?
JB: Yeah, but I'm not fucking what he thinks I am. I'm going as a spy bro. I'm going in there. I'm gonna infiltrate-  the revolut- the revolution starts from inside bro. I go in - hear me out. I go in. I fuckin' s-s-s-check out out the joint. I scope the joint. I figure out what makes them tick and then I fucking get you a ticket
KG: I don't like this plan
JB: I get you a ticket!
KG: Where are you gonna find me!? You're in space!
JB: Kage, I'm sorry. I've got to go!


KG: No! No! Don't go!
KG: Hope, come here boy. Hope, come here! Hope, where are you going?

KG: Hope, boy, come back! Come here! Hope!?

KG: I've lost Hope

Brrah!
Yeah!

Near the city known as Budapest

JB: Well, if you didn't like that, how 'bout this? KAY!
KG: OW!
JB: KI-AY!
KG: D'oh!

A long-ass fucking time ago
In a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family
Religious through and through
But yay, there was a black sheep
And he knew just what to do
His name was young JB
And he refused to step in line
A vision he did see
Of fucking rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam
And all the planets did align

Oh, the dragon's balls were blazing
As I stepped into his cave
Then I sliced his fucking cockles
With a long and shiny blade
'Twas I who fucked the dragon
Fuckali, sing fuckaloo
And if you try to fuck with me
Then I shall fuck you too

Got to get it on in the party zone
I gots to shoot a load in the party zone
Gotta lick a toad in the party zone
Gotta suck a chode in the party zone, ah
You've disobeyed my orders, son
Why were you ever born?
Your brother's ten times better than you
Jesus loves him more
This music that you play for us
Comes from the depths of Hell
Rock and Roll's the Devil's work
He wants you to rebel
You'll become a mindless puppet
Beelzebub will pull the strings
Your heart will lose direction
And chaos it will bring

You better shut your mouth
You better watch your tone
You're grounded for a week
With no telephone
Don't let me hear you cry
Don't let me hear you moan
You gotta praise the Lord
When you're in my home

Dio, can you hear me?
I am lost and so alone
I'm asking for your guidance
Won't you come down from your throne?
I need the tight compadre
Who will teach me how to rock
My father thinks you're evil
But man, he can suck a cock
Rock is not the Devil's work
It's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as I am
Stuck here with my Dad
I hear you, brave young Jables
You are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient method
Sacred doors you must unlock
Escape your father's clutches
And this oppressive neighborhood
On a journey you must go
To find the land of Hollywood

In the City of Fallen Angels
Where the ocean meets the sand
You will form a strong alliance
And the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune
Through the Valley you must walk
You will face your inner demons
Now go, my son, and Rock

So he bailed from fucking Kickapoo
With hunger in his heart
And he journeyed far and wide
To find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew
That he would find his counterpart
Rock
Rock
Rock
Jack: Let's kick it. I'll say kick it, and you'll just kick it with a tasty groove, okay? 1, 2, 3, kick it.........kick it, come on, god damn it, GOD, KYLE! COULD YOU ONE TIME KICK IT, WHAT THE FUCK?
Kyle: Jack, don't put it all on me...I've been sitting here, waitin'
Jack: Okay, we've got a cruicial, clutch cargo gig coming up, Kyle. you COCK SUCKER! YOU don't give a shit, and I've been sittin' around, getting sick of your attitude!! YOU FUCKER! YOU FFFUCKIN' BITCH!
Kyle: I don't think I like Your attitude
(Jack interrupts) YOU FUCKER!
You know what?! I quit!
Kyle gets up, walks away, opens a door, and closes the door
Jack cries

(Dude we gotta fuckin' write somethin' new
Come on)
Strums a chord
I don't like that
So far, ba-- Off to a bad start
KG strums another chord
Better, closer, warmer
KG strums another chord
That's it! Okay
Music starts up

I love ya baby but all I can think about is
Kielbasa sausage, your butt cheeks is warm
I check my dipstick, you need lubrication, honey
My kielbasa sausage has just got to perform
Now get it on

I see ya walkin' but all I can think about is
Dianetics, your butt cheeks is warm
I check my dipstick, you need lubrication, honey
My kielbasa sausage has just got to perform
Now I been set loose, ah, I'm shooting my juice, ah
Right in your caboose, now fuckin' get it on
Now get it on
Get it on
Dianetics junior much better than Krishna
Dianetics cure you much better indeed
And all you people here, you're tremendous
(Except the people in the back)
And you're smoking up a big-ass bowl of weed with me and KG
All right, oh yeah, all right, oh my God
All the ladies in the house say yeah (yeah)
All you motherfuckers say a prayer (prayer)
When you fight, you got to fight fair
You motherfucker, oh, you motherfucker
You know what time it is?
Tenacious D time, you motherfucker, go!
Fuck yeah
Yeah, yeah

Dude, that was TNT

Kooooooong!

There's a little place I know
Where a bunch of funky people live
They were looking for a sacrifice
One that they had to give

To King Kong
Where did he go wrong?
King Kong
That's why I wrote this song
King Kong
They took him to a world
Where he don't belong

Had to find a lady to give to Kong
To keep that chunky monkey tame
He fell in love with Naomi Watts's character
I forget her name
Okay, I have to admit, I didn't read the script
'Cause I find that it gets in the way
Of my acting process, which I've carefully honed
And also I don't know how to read
King Kong
Pass the grey poupon
King Kong
Fighting the Vietkong
King Kong
Everybody bang a gong
For King Kong
'Cause he don't belong

Alright, this is where the song gets really personal, so listen up

I show up at the set at a quarter to noon
Then I pretend to get a nasty cramp
So I could get back to my sweet-ass trailer
And take myself a tasty nap
Then the director dude would come and pound on my door
And say, "Jack, this has got to STOP!"
But then the next day, I had my sweet revenge
By urinating in his coffee pot

On the set of King Kong!
Wears a massive thong
King Kong
He got it going on
King Kong
Jack Black wrote this song
So do yourself a favor
Please clap along
Everybody now
Clap with me
But do not sing
The singing's my job
You'll only mess up the song, trust me
One, two, three

King Kong
Open in Hong Kong
King Kong
He listens to Cheech and Chong
King Kong
This is his theme song

He's a crazy old gorilla
And he guarantee a thrilla
And once you see the movie
You'll be feeling pretty groovy
And a rooby dooby da ba do ba ba bo oh
KING KONG!
Kooonnnng!
Kooonnnng!
There is nothing on Earth that is nearly as strong
As Kong!
Kooonnnng!
In the jungle he lives, that is where he belongs
King Kong!
Kooonnnng!
Beat the drum, light the flames, sacrifice, bang the gong!
King Kong!
King
Kooonnnng!
Killing all in his path, save for that which he longs
King Kooonnnng!
Kooonnnng!
There is nothing on Earth that is nearly as strong
As Kong!
Kooonnnng!
In the jungle he lives, that is where he belongs
King Kong!
Kooonnnng!
Beat the drum, light the flames, sacrifice, bang the gong!
King Kong!
Kooonnnng!
Killing all in his path, save for that which he longs
King Kong!
King
Kong
King

I wasn't very popular in high school
And I felt like I needed some group of people to accept me and to love me for who I am
And this is a song about that

Everything sucked in high school
So I moved to the Middle East
I kicked ass with the Krishna
I took on their belief, sister!

Ah Hare Hare!
Ah Hare Krishna!
Oh fuckin' Hare!

Now I'm back home now
Momma don't like me
Daddy don't recognize me

Well Hare Hare!
Ah Hare Krishna!
Oh fuckin' Hare!
Ah Hare Eh!

Last week Kyle quit the band
Now we're back together, uh
Misunderstanding, didn't understand
It doesn't matter, now we're back together again
Ha-la-la-la-la-la
Couldn't split up Kato and Nash
(That's true)
Couldn't split up Tango and Cash
That's also true
This is our song of exultant joy, because
We only came to kick some ass
Rock the fuckin' house and kick some ass
What we gonna do with all the cash?
Smoke hash, and then we thrash
We'll throw a big ol' bash, y'all
And everyone is invited to the bash
And everyone, you're all invited to the bash

Come on Kyle
One time, come on

Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee
Lee L-Lee, L-Lee, Lee Lee L-Lee
We're talkin' fuckin' Lee
I had a friend named Lee
He cast a spell, a spell on me
If me and Lee and KG could be three

Skinny dipping in a sea of Lee
I'd propose on bended knee
To Lee Lee Lee

Ah, Lee
Fuck
Well, me and Kage are hungry
We're hungry for some fruit
We wander through the garden
It would be a hoot
To eat some low hangin' fruit
We're on a freaky pursuit
Don't want no high class model in designer fuckin' bathing suit
We want the low hangin' fruit
Me and Kage are horny
We're lookin' for a snack
Lookin' for a plump one
With a tasty crack
We want some low hangin' fruit
She wear the pink parachute
She got the shit kickin' boots
We need the low hangin' fruit
She got the flip-flops on with hot red potatoes
And the butt-floss on with fried green tomatoes
And she love that song we sing for the ladies
Come on! Oh my god!
Let's start at a flip (random noises)
Low hangin' fruit
She wears a pink parachute
She got the fly tattoo and the honky-tonky daisy dukes, whoo
We love the low hangin' fruit
Because the high-class fruit is not gonna fuck me
But the low-class fruit is sweet chunky monkey
When you smoke that fruit, you smell like a skunky
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

Relax JB, it'll be alright
Go with it, don't be afraid, we are your friends and more
It's important that we fuck right now, so let your penis explore
Repopulation is the name of the game
We need to fuck you right away
This is no time for being shy, let us have your seed today

C'mon JB, they just wanna fuck, just give 'em whatcha got
You're fuckin' bringing down the mood
You gotta use that fuckin' cock

Oh no, I'm feeling so vulnerable, not ready to give you my load
I do not really know you, not sure if I can trust you with my heart
You might break my heart
I can't give you my load if I don't feel safe

Look at Kyle, he's got the idea, that's it, Kage, see? He knows
Suck his fingertips, lick his ear hole
Suck his toes, and lick his butthole
Suck his balls, obviously, his cock, sit on him, make him explode

Excuse me, hello, my name is Conchita and I'm also painfully shy
I do not like orgies unless I'm incredibly high
I know we just met but please hold me as tight as a glove
I cannot have sex unless I am completely in love
Making love, making love, making love, making love
Making love, making love, making love
Making love, making love, making love, making love
Making love, making love, making love

Well, you didn't come out with this one
Plays riff
I got some lyrics

Malibu nights, tangerine dreams
Malibu neighs, Malibu dreams
Malibu, makin' a poo
Stinky poo, lookin' at you
Because it's time for my breakfast
It's time for the stink, it's time for the breeze
Time for the... ha-leeeeee!

Hey, what the fuck y'all doing there?
(What?)
We three KKK guys are the security, and we caught you. What you think you're doing?
(We were just, uh, we were just taking a look at the White House)
We're just passing through. We're, we're nothing. We're not doing nothing. We're just leaving
(Yeah. No harm here. Yeah)
The fuck you is. You 'bout to be killed motherfuckers
(No, don't kill us!)
Uh, I beg to differ
I got them all with my robot fist on the head I knock them out
(Ah, good work!)
But still. Look at all those fucking soldiers. Ah fuck!

March, march, march, march

This uh next band asked me not to read this
But, goddammit, I'm going to read it anyway
Because I wrote it, and it's the truth
I fucking love this band
They're the best band ever, period
Ladies and gentlemen, Tenacious D
Hey, what's up
Me and KG wrote this song 5 minutes ago
It's called "Master Exploder"

Ahh!

I do not need
He does not need
A microphone
A microphone
My voice is fucking
Fucking
Powerful!

Ahh
Ah-aaah!
Sorry
I did not mean
He did not mean
To blow your mind
To blow your mind
But that shit happened to me
All the time

Now take a look
Take a look
Tell me what do you see?
What do you see?
We've got the Pick
Of Destiny

Ahh
Ahhh-yea!

I do not need
He does not need
A microphone
A microphone
My voice is fucking
Fucking
Powerful!

Ahh
Ah-aaah!
Sorry

I did not mean
He did not mean
To blow your mind
To blow your mind
But that shit happened to me
All the time

Now take a look
Take a look
Tell me what do you see?
What do you see?
We've got the Pick
Of Destiny
Ahh
Ahhh-yea!
And one time i could advise
But now I'm lost in my own pain
The habits have captured me
And now i feel them reign
So easy to call you
So easy to die another death
I can't seem to fall through
Won't you heat me with your breath
Who am i kidding?
It wasn't that good
But absence magnifies
As well as it could
And as well as it should
So let it go
From your eyes
And i miss you
And ill never kiss you again
And i miss you

JACK: Uh, what are you doing?
KYLE: What do you think you're doing?
JACK: We told you not to listen to this side. There's nothing on this side.
KYLE: Don't listen to side B!
JACK: Look, you're wasting your time, you're wasting our time. You got a little greedy, didn't ya? You listened to the jazz, you said "I wonder what's on side B? I know it says 'don't listen to it, there's nothing on there', I'm gonna listen to it anyway". That's you. How dare you? How dare you look and see what's on this side? No respect for the written word.
KYLE: Mm-mm, mm-mm. None.
JACK: Well, sorry to say, but now you're gonna be punished. Bap! Okay? That's for your eardrums. That's for your eardrums.
KYLE: Feel good? You like that? *whispers* You like that?
JACK: Flip the vinyl over, listen to side A. Explore the jazz!
KYLE: Enjoy.
KG: Jack?
JB: Yeah?
KG: Do you think some people, do you think that there's some people that are really, that are actually robots living among us-

KG: -but we can't tell?
JB: No we don't have that technology yet. But Rage, Rage, Rage-
KG: Yeah?
JB: -you know what I was thinking? Stop playing, I was thinking of a fuckin' brilliant song
KG: Yeah?
JB: Check it out, just do what I do
KG: Ok...
JB: Just play this note
(Plays)
JB: Then we both, just keep both playing that note. Every once in a while bend it. And that's it and just remember who wrote that song - ME! Baby, ME!
KG: (Sighs)
JB: See it's fuckin' simple, that's one song in the bank, next song-
KG: Is th-
JB: Next song!
KG: -how could, but it's one note
JB: NEXT!
KG: Anybody coulda wrote it, anybody coulda done that, one song, just one note

Look into the Sasquatch eye, then you'll know that Sass can fly
Sasquatch is my daddy and he's got to protect me
Half man, and half machine
On the front cover of a magazine
Bigfoot is my father and he's got to protect me
These lyrics don't make sense
I think I found the evidence
That yeti is my papa and he wants to protect me
Do you know where I can find the Pick of Destiny?
Sure, it's wight over there!
Let's get it!
I can get it if I surf on your back- Ah!

You know a lot of times when me and Kage sit down to write a song
The ideas blast forth bleeding together like wine
Now only once every hunnert years or so
Does there come a duo with a power to change music...

So re-co-cord and
And pa-pa-pardon
Pardon my aim...

The music is beautiful but so is the lyrics
That's why we gots to say Way to be...
Way to be
Ben Vereen was a Raging Queen, but he
Rocked the house in Pippin, so come on...
Way to be

Kyle's giving guitar lessons now
Rocking guitar: reasonable rates
But seriously folks -
He's teaching guitar
There was a man with a plan and his name was Pat Reilly
He roused the troops and he said come on Mighty D
He professed to rock The D...
Join hands, make plans
Peter Pan, it's a Caravan!
Way to be

And With a clean block shot and a D Rebound
Secret to the Magic of Life we've found
We got to count on D to be, and
We got to count on D to be, and
We got to count on D to be, yeaow!
Go!

Cause it's the Pick of Destiny child
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fuckin' insane
It's just the Pick of Destiny child
More precious than a diamond on a platinum chain
In Venice Beach there was a man named Kage
When he buskin he was all the rage
He met Jables and he taught him well
All the techniques that were developed in hell
Cock-pushups and the power slide
Gig simulation now there's nowhere to hide
They formed a band they named Tenacious D
And then they got the Pick Of Destiny
Cause it's the Pick of Destiny child
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fuckin' insane
It's just the Pick of Destiny child
Our tasty moves are better than a chicken chow mein
Cause he who is sleazy
Is easy to pleasy
And she who is juicy
Must be loosy-goosey
And he who is groovy
Will be in my movie, so come on!
The wizard and the demon had a battle royale
The demon almost killed him with an evil kapow
But then he broke his tooth
And thus the demon said Ow
Cause it's the Pick of Destiny child
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fuckin' insane
It's just the Pick of Destiny child
You know our movie's better than a Citizen Kane
Cause he who's a geezer
Must live in my freezer
And she who is snarky
Is full of malarkey
And he who is groovy
Must be in my movie, so come on!
Cause if you're a diva
Then go to Geneva
And if you're a croney
Then suck on my boney
And if you are groovy
Then get in my movie
It's called the Pick of Destiny
It's called the Pick of Destiny!

Apocalypto, end of the world
Apocalypto, searching for that special girl
She's the last one in the world
Ride!
Apocalypto, end of the line
Apocalypto this is our time to shine
Tenacious D has got to shine
Apocalypto, fight to prevail
Apocalypto, if we fight we cannot fail
Got to find that holy grail
Kayay!
Apocalypto, fight to survive
Apocalypto, got to find some way to thrive
Don't you give us any jive
Since the beginning of time
There had to be a man with a plan
To push man, forward
There was a caveman who, invented wheels
And with those wheels he pushed man forward
Someone had to come up with a new concept for life
Had to push the mighty rock upon the mountain top
Got to work it out
Got to think outside the box
You got to think outside the bun
If you want to be the magic one
Who will lead the trail, blaze the rail
Be the one that you will know must me
Genius
Everybody looks to the hero to lead the way, to change our way of life
To show us something that is meaningful, yeah
When you look to the hero you must seize the day and shine a ray of light
Gotta shine it on something that is beautiful, yeah
With the bravery to see, a new form of arts
A blazing of our consciousness, we're talking quantum leap
When you think outside the bun
It's scary out there
There's also lots of stinky poo
But sometimes when you go outside of your comfort zone
You might find something brand new
To help the humans leap
Forward, do a simple leap
Never be they same, they leap
Across the fucking annals of time
Quantum leap, leap
Einstein, Shakespeare, Leonard Nimoy, Doctor Drew
Bell Biv DeVoe, François Truffaut, Moses, Tenacious D
That's a list of the people who have made the quantum leap
It gets pretty scary out there because they got to know themselves, yeah
When you look at the people who have made the quantum leap
You feel like a turd cause you haven't accomplished anything yourselves, no
With the bravery to see, a new form of arts
A blazing of our consciousness, we're talking quantum leap, leap, leap, leap
Sleep

KG: Yeah, I'm gonna commit suicide! In five, four, three, two-
JB: Don't even think about it bro
KG: Jack?
JB: Step away from the cliff
KG: You're back
JB: Yeah, lemme tell you something. That space station was pretty rad except for one thing. I was missing my bro
KG: You were?
JB: When we started Tenacious D we formed a bond that's to the death
KG: You did
JB: I love you bro!

JB: A bond! Hug me and hold me!
KG: Okay, I will. I will
JB: Kiss me on the lips
Daddy Ding Dong: Not so fast!

Daddy Ding Dong: Great, now I have you all in my tentacles. Ah, I'll begin with you and your little doggy

Daddy Ding Dong: You are the one who killed my beloved daughter, Crackalacka Ding Dong. And now, you shall pay with your life. But first, I'm gonna sing you a song. It go a little bit something like this
Rivers of brown
All flowin' down
I like to say kaka
Rivers of gold
Flowin' from us all
I like to say Cuervo
Rivers of white
Blastin' through the night
I like to say coco
Rivers of brown
Now they're rainin' down
On your phoney crown
Your phoney crown of brown
Fuck yeah yeah
I like to caca
And I like to pee pee

When The Pick of Destiny was released, it was a bomb
And all the critics said that the D was done
The sun had set and the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about was the D would rise again

Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again, yah

'Cause the fiery heart of a champion cannot be quelched
By a failure or an embarrassment, no way, no
And the critics all agreed it was a stinky pile of cheese
But that does not mean that our hearts are not strong

Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again, yah
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again
Ah

Sun shinin', it's a hell of a day
Ridin' back and it's headed your way
D's here, now we're puttin' on a show
We're sneakin' up, climbin' into your window
Hard rockin', yeah, we're rockin' again
Black Mamba is my personal friend
Phil Jackson is the master of zen
We'll pick you up, take you out for the weekend

It's the rise of the phoenix
It's a call of attack
And you'll know when you've seen us
The fuckin' D is back, yah

Love-makin' all the way to the top
Boots smokin', but I'm not gonna stop
Bossa nova is a beautiful dance
Hot-blooded, that's a lots of romance

It's the rise of the phoenix
And we ride with the pack
It's the magic between us
The fuckin' D is back

But what if it's true?
If Tenacious D has died, what will we do?
And what will we do
'Bout all the fans who have the D tattoo?
They'll have them removed
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos
Tattoo
They'll have to laser off their D tattoo, ah
Wait a minute, Kage
What's that you say?
You know it's not too late
Yes, it is too late
We only need one hit
Just imagine it
We could be the shit
Too legit to quit

One hit, one hit, one hit
Yeah, we're hoping this is it
One hit, top ten hit
Top forty hit, top thousand hit
I don't care, as long as we get there
We'll start anew
And you can get a new Tenacious D tattoo
You can get a new Tenacious D tattoo
Well, it's 3pm, time to lug the gear
Gotta get it on the stage
My muscles flex, my fuckin' sweat will save the day
When I check the mic, I fuckin' check the mic
I fuckin' checka-checka one, two, three
I plug it in, I make it sound as good as can be
'Cause the rockers rock, but the roadies roll
Gotta take mic because I take control
Gotta get that shit up on that fuckin' stage
Because the roadie knows what the roadie knows
And the roadie knows that he wears black clothes
And he hides off in the shadows off the stage
Because the roadie
Looks a thousand miles with his eyes
And when the crowd roars
Brings a tear drop to the roadie's eyes
Tears of pride
Because he brought you the show
But you will never know
He's changing the strings
While hiding in the wings
No matter how hard
The show must go on
Then a beautiful girl come to me
She say, "Hey can I sucka your dick?"
I say "Yes", I am in love
Then she quickly say "I sucked your dick
Now give me that backstage pass
I do not want you roadie, I want KG's chode"
I'm standing at the threshold of your dreams
Without me there'd be no sound from those amps
Without me there'd be no lights on the stage
But you don't applaud for me
No, I am the roadie
Lonesome warrior searching for the soul
No, I am the roadie
I make the rock go
Roadie, roadie, roadie
I am a robot, naked and alone
Sent from the future to build a new home
Mission accomplished, find The D
Save them from Daddy Ding Dong
And build a home make it right make it nice
Kill all the evil and the Nazis
KKK, kill them all, dat what me must do
I am a robot, I am here alone
Just like a doggy, searching for his bone
Everyone sees me but no one understands
The feeling inside when I have an empty hand
No one will put me in their band
'Cause everyone hates a robot
But I am such a good robot
I am not an evil robot understand
I am just a simple robot hold my hand
And one of these days, I'll be a man
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah
Oh-oh-ooh-rid-di-di-di-di-di-kyu
Rocket
Rocket
All of my Rocket Sauce
All of my f**kin' Rocket Sauce
All of my Rocket Sauce
Hey!
Rocket
Rocket
All of my Rocket sauce... all of my...
Dude Thats the ice cream song...
Yea, i know kyle...
Go
Rock is dead, rock is dead
Rock is dead, rock is dead
Talk to my friend, that's what he said
Is rock still around? No, rock is dead
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
Bottle of jack, Mercury, Fred
Muscle car, Grateful Dead
Lord of the Rings, Zeppelin the Led
Devil tattoo, Right Said Fred
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
Take it, Kones!

Started with blues, Belly of lead
Then there was Elvis, makin' some bread
Beatles arrive, started to shred
Axel Rose, give me some head
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
Rock is dead, rock is dead
Rock is dead, rock is dead
Get that freight train out of my head
Because a rock and a roll is a fuckin' dead
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
It's all over, rock and roll is dead
It's all over, rock and roll
Oh, so baby now, rock and roll
R-r-r-r-r-rock and roll
Is dead
Woo
 
Shush for just one moment, there's something wrong with our electric guitar player
(Something wrong with Kones?)
Look at him
(It's like he's catatonic or something. What's wrong with him?)
Do you hear that creepy sound?
(I do!)
It's like a theremin. It can only mean one thing: he's posessed!
(Posessed? By who?)
By Satan, of course!

I am complete!

Fu-uuck

Yes, you are fucked
Shit out of luck
Now I'm complete
And my cock you will suck
This world will be mine
And you're first in line
You brought me the pick
And now you shall both die
Wait, wait
Wait you motherfucker
We challenge you to a rock-off
Give us one chance to rock your socks off

Fuck, fuck
Fuuuuuuck
The demon code prevents me
From declining a rock-off challenge
What are your terms?
What's the catch?

If we win
You must take your sorry ass back to Hell
And also, you will have to pay our rent

And what if I win?

Then you can take Kage back to Hell...
(That sounds like a fair dea- What?)
Trust me Kage, it's the only way
To be your little bitch
Fine
I'm the Devil
I love Metal
Check this riff
It's fucking tasty
I'm the Devil, I can do what I want
Whatever I've got I'm gonna flaunt
There's never been a rock-off
That I've ever lost
I can't wait to take Kage back to Hell
I'm gonna fill him with my hot demon gel
I'll make him squeal
Like my Scarlet Pimpernel

Noooooo!
Come on Kyle, let's fight his music with our music
(There's just no way that we can win
That was a masterpiece)
Listen to me
(He rocks too hard
Because he's not a mortal man)
Goddammit, Kage!
He's gonna make you his sex slave
You're gonna gargle Mayonnaise
(*Growls*)
Unless we bust a massive monster mamma-jam
(Dude, we've been through so much shit)
Deactivated lasers with my dick
Now it's time to blow this fucker down!
Come on, Kage
Now it's time to blow doors down
(I hear you Jables
Now it's time to blow doors down)
Light up the stage
'Cause it's time for a showdown
(We'll bend you over
Then we'll take you to brown town)
Now it's time to blow this fucker down
(He's gonna rape me if we do not blow doors down)
Come on Kage
'Cause it's time to blow doors down
(Oooh, we'll piledrive ya
It's time for the smackdown)
Hey Antichrister
Beelzeboss

To waking up at the crack of noon
For deep-knee rock squats!
Seven or eight at a time, in a row
How 'bout are you willing to make the commitment
To rock hard tasty abs, washer board style
Glistening in the sun
How 'bout are you willing to make the commitment
Waking up, going "Okay, it's gig time
What T-shirt am I gonna wear?
Can't decide, can't decide, brain aneurysm!"
We've been through so much bullshit
Just to be here tonight to rock your fuckin' socks off
And all we ask in return is so precious little
All we're askin' you to do is drop trou'
And squeeze out a Cleveland Steamer on my chest (Oh...)

There were some scientists tried to figure the Sasquatch riddle
Then they figured out it was a missing link
"In Search of Sasquatch" that was a kickass In Search of
With Leonard Nimoy kicking out the jams (Ahhh!)

He captured imaginations of people all around the globe
His name was Sasquatch so I'm told
His legend's ancient in the ancient scribe
Of the Indian tribe (Apache tribe)

Scientists have proven that the Sasquatch seems real
Take a look at the plastic cast of his foot now you know he's real
Listen real close to the audiotape now you will now know he's real
Couldn't be a man in gorilla suit no fuckin' way now you know he's real
Real (real) real-real (real) real (really real) real real!


KG: Don't take this personally, cause it's not about your playing
JB: No dude, your drumming is kick-ass
It's just that the D it's always just been me and KG
KG: And we're just not comfortable being a power trio
JB: I hope there's no hard feelings
Sasquatch (Sasquatch)
We know your legend's real
Sasquatch (Sasquatch)
We know your love is real
Sasquatch
You and Tenacious D
Are
Real

Sasquatch: Tell Tenacious D They were kick-ass
Open Mic Host: And who should I tell them said that?
Sasquatch: Tell them it was Sasqua- Tell them it was a friend
Open Mic Host: Okay

Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey

Sasquatch: You know what, you better tell them it was Sasquatch. They won't know what friend you're talking about
Open Mic Host: Oh, Okay, Sure
Sasquatch: See ya
Open Mic Host: So long
Save the world, save the world
You've got to save the world
Save the world
All the boys and girls
From around the world
You've got to save the world
Save the world
Scientist: Stay where you are!
KG: Ah! Oh, I'm sorry? What?
Scientist: We have laser blaster pistols. We will shoot you and kill you to the ground
KG: We don't mean any harm. We come in peace. We come in peace
Scientist: Stay where you are, I can see your hands
KG: Wait, where are you from?
Scientist: Where are we from? We are from MIT. Where else? We are the top uttermost scientists in all of the world surviving Anyway, and we are putting the finishing touches this uh, this spaceship because there is a, um, what you call a space station in space that is called a Valhalla, it is very huge
KG: Valhalla. Hm
Scientist: Very spacious so much fun to do and things to do and uh
KG: That's great!
Scientist: Oh-ho-ho. Let me tell you first who is up on the station before you start saying what you think is great. Richard Branson is up there, of course. Also you got Yo-Yo Ma up there, and only the finest and smartest and richest allowed on the space station, so
KG: Please take us to space. Please, we are the best band in the world. We're way better than Yo-Yo Ma. Please let us audish
Scientist: Well, you know, what the hell? Show us what you got. We'll see what you think of it. Blow, blow our minds, you never know!
JB: Alright Kage, you ready?
Señorita, tasty mamacita
Tell me baby, what's your name
Oh, Conchita, won't you have a seat-a
Tell me baby, who's to blame?
I'll fuckin' kill the man who has done you wrong
My body's shakin' out of control
His name is Larry, oh, he's really scary
Drinkin' at the fuckin' bar
Tap his shoulder, muscles like a boulder
Tell him that's he's gone too far
He laughs and tells me to fuckin' fuck myself
Now my blood is boilin' over my soul
Hey!

I'm sorry, I didn't hear that
Did you just tell me to fuckin' fuck myself?
Yeah
Well, I'm telling you to step outside
Oh really?
Yeah, we got some things to talk about
A little lady named Conchita
Hey!
Yeah, you harmed her
What? Who said? Who are you?
Yeah, fuck you you piece of shit
*Fight*
When my fist connects and Larry falls down to the ground
I see he's cut me with a bottle
My pistol rises, 'cause it's time to double down
Larry runs, I chase him out full-throttle
Donde estas mi horse? Alli
Digame, donde estas Larry? Alli?
En los montañes? Donde, en el cañon?
Muy bien, cold-water cañon?
Andale, pues, ha, ha, ha
Ah, te amo mi Conchita
Yo tengo hambre para tu boca
Mira mi cara
Soy en fuego para tu beso
Mi amor
Watchin' Larry in his sanctuary thinkin' that he got away
With Conchita, oh, my mamacita, kissing him upon the face
I fuckin' rue the day that I fought for you
Now my mind is spinnin' out of control
Ah, I'm sorry mamacita
Oh, my little señorita
Ah, I'm sorry, señorita
That's the first thing I say to you
How's it goin'? Are you flowin'?
Listen honey, thinkin' 'bout
A couple things to say to you
Showin', growin'
And I'd like to place my hands
Upon your fuckin' sexy ass
And squeeze and squeeze
Take off your blouse and your underpants
Then take a look 'cause here me and KG come naked
Out of the side hatch, pretty oils and perfume and incense
Now you're groovin', put on a cool '70's groove
A funky groove to fuck you
The funky groove that fucks you
You guessed it, me, me and KG
It's all about sex supreme
We likes to cream jeans
Have you ever been worked on by two guys
Who are hot for your snatch? That's what I'm offerin' you
You step into our room and then you smell the perfumes
You lay upon our roundish bed
And then you feel a tickling on your head
It's KG with a feather, the French tickler
Look out baby, he's got the tools
And then you feel somethin' down by your feet
It's me, it's JB, I'm suckin' on your toes
We don't mind suckin' on toes
Good luck finding a boyfriend who sucks toes
Havin' sex with me and KG
Now you're talkin' double-team, supreme
Jazz
Jazz
Floating through space
Time has no meaning
Large empty space
Time isn't there
Grooving through time
Life has no meaning
Sexualization of the jazz
Jazz
Crawling through time
Finding the gold
Digging deep through the earth looking for gold
But finding only space
Jazz
Stinky jazz
Flowing through jazz
Time has no meaning
Forty-five minutes of non stop jazz
I'm sorry I was mistaken
It's two hours and seventy-eight minutes of non-stop jazz
You cannot stop the jazz
You cannot cut, quite cut off the head of jazz
But you can smell the jazz
Can you taste the jazz?
It tastes like honeysuckle dew drops from the breeze of ancient nations
I'm not quite sure that you want the jazz
You cannot like the jazz
You're pretty sure that you hate the jazz
And yet you are the jazz
Jazz
Who put the devil into my jazz
I said
Who put Beelzeboss into my jazz
Who put Satan into my jazz
Was it you? Was it you? Who did it?
There's Satan in my jazz
The devil is in my jazz
Too much Satan in my jazz
Me and Kage are hungry
We're hungry for some jazz
That's Kones on electric
That's Spike on the bass
That's Brooks on the drums
That's Kage in your face
And little ol' me on voc's
The vox
The thing you know to be true
Yeah
A new direction for the D
It's absolutely certain that we will sell many records this way
But that's not why we do it, no
There's simply nothing to it, no
Our hearts have led us this way
But have our hearts led us astray?
Yes
I'm afraid our hearts have led us astray
Why do you do it?
Why you do it this way?
Because the jazz has no meaning
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it coming from the ugly down below?
That's the feeling, don't ya know
Of the scat man
Jazz man
It's an ancient jazz
It's an ancient kind of jazz
It's a sweet taste of jazz
Aw, that sweet, delicious Jazz
Aw, that scrumptious jazz
Get inside the jazz
Let it take you higher
Let it take you all the way
To the other side of the universe of your soul
Jazz
And stop!2

Well, me and K.G., yeah, we're going to sing
A little song about a few special things
Special things
Talking special things

Helps his little buddy to understand

A very special thing
Yeah, take it J.B t- take it

I hate to interrupt the thing
That Lee was singing about him and K.G
Special thing
What do you think this is? Tenacious D: 3-D
Oh, no, no, no...
Like when K.G. hits a tin cup shot... on a Genesis golf (Tin Cup!)
That's a special thing
A special thing!
Or when K.G
Pops in Jenny Craig mac and chee-
And hands it to me
That's a special thing

You gotta take us into space
We gotta save the human race
But first you gotta let us say goodbye
Goodbye Mother Earth, you served us well
Your rolling hills, your gorgeous lakes
You have been swell
Your fucking flowers, your fresh breeze
Your blue skies all day
Your twinkling stars, your northern lights
It's time to go away
Me and KG are going into space
And we are never coming home again
We're gonna miss you, we'll never kiss you
We're gonna go have lots of sex in space
Sex in space
Farewell my friend
We're talking to the Earth again
We're gonna party with Elon Musk in space
Ah-ah-ha yeah
Richard Branson partying hard
We're gonna kick it with him
We're gonna drink some space juice mixed with gin
Oh yeah
We're partying in space to save the human race
We're gonna have to shoot some goo
We're cumming in space
We're cumming inside of you
Part 1: Pinball Wizard
Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure played a mean motherfucking pinball
Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure played a mean motherfucking pinball
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
Part 2: Thеre's a Doctor
There's a man I'vе found
Could bring us all joy!
There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!
A doctor I've found can cure the boy!
There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow
He lives in this town let's see him tomorrow
Let's see him tomorrow!
Part 3: Go to the Mirror
I often wonder what he is thinking
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?
Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story
What is happening in his head
Ooooh I wish I knew, I wish I knew1
(incorrectly listed song, this is just an excerpt from the song "Kielbasa")
This is the ballad of Hollywood Jack and the Rage Kage
Nothing could stop them when Jables and Rage hit the stage
And Hollywood Jack hit the big time and went to make movies
Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams
And he grumbled and growled and watched Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno
He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage
He burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doing mushrooms
"Fuck him! I don't need no Hollywood Jack, anyway!"
So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble
And Rage Kage lived deep in the broiling valley below
Yes, the Rage Kage bubbled with rage
He looked at the ground and he looked on the stage
The lava was flowin' and broilin' inside the old Kage
As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him
He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door
He'd make millions and then he'd go out and he'd make even more millions
He'd screen KG's calls and snort coke off the ass of a whore
No one respected him, they just rejected him
No one would represent Kage
Left on the streets of his dreams, he would cry and he'd rage
For the stage, ah
Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble
They sent Kage away 'cause he had gone completely insane
So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jet plane
And flew all that night through the rain
To be with his friend and see what remained of his brain
Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors, "You've got to retrieve him
You've got the technology, use the techniques of your trade"
He grabbed their lapels and he screamed, "By God, you must save him!
Because Rage Kage and I, can't you see, that we're one and the same?"
Ah, Rage Kage, oh, Rage Kage
There be magic inside that old name
And you know that you know
When you're going completely insane
Ah, the Rage Kage, ah, the Rage Kage
Oh, the lion will roar once again
And you know, yes, you know
When you're going completely insane
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Hollywood Jack and Rage Kage will ride once again1
This is the ballad of Hollywood Jack and the Rage Kage
Nothin' could stop him when Jables and Rage hit the stage
And Hollywood Jack hit the big time and went to make movies
Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams
And he grumbled and growled and watched Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno
He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage
He burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doin' mushrooms
Fuck him! I don't need no Hollywood Jack, anyway
So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble
And Rage Kage lived deep in the broiling valley below
Yes the Rage Kage bubbled with rage
He looked at the ground and he looked on the stage
The lava was flowin' and broilin' inside the old Kage
As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him
He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door
He'd make millions and then he'd go out and make even more millions
He'd screen KG's calls and snort coke off the ass of a whore
No one respected him, they just rejected him
No one would represent Kage
Left on the streets of his dreams he would cry
And he'd rage, for the stage
Ahahaaa
Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble
They sent Kage away cause he had gone completely insane
So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jet plane
And flew all that night through the rain
To be with his friend, to see what remained of his brain
Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors, "You've got to retrieve him
You've got the technology, use the techniques of your trade"
He grabbed the lapels and he screamed, "By God, you must save him!
Because Rage Kage and I, can't you see that we're one in the same?"
Aaaah!
Rage Kage
Oh, Rage Kage
There be magic inside that old name
And you know
That you know
When you're going completely insane
Ah, the Rage Kage
Ah, the Rage Kage
Oh, the lion will roar once again
And you know
Yes, you know
When you're going completely insane
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again
Hollywood Jack and Rage Kage will ride once again

So, um...
If I was gonna say just one thing to y'all tonight
I'd say, set the artist free
I'm talking about this artist, in here
Set it free
I'm saying, quit your day job

Now, I know a lot of you people here
You're saying
"I can't quit my day job
I've got kids to feed, Jack"
Quit your day job
Focus on your craft
One time
Before it's all over
You've died
You've squandered it
You fucking robots!

Now, after a couple of years
Of you focusing earnestly on your craft
K.G. and I will swoop in
We will check out your progress
And we will encourage you
To continue
Or we will say, stop
And then, seriously, you must stop
Or penalties will be created and enforced
'Cause listen
This is the problem
Sometimes you follow your heart
Sometimes your heart cuts a fart
That's the cosmic shame
That's the cosmic shame

And I know what you are saying now
What makes you guys so fucking good?
I don't fucking know
And I don't like it
I stay up going, fuck
Why can't everybody fucking have it?

'Cause this is the thing
Some people learn it on the streets
Some people learn it in the schools
Me and K.G
We were fucking born with it, holmes
'Cause, check it out

That shit came off
The top of my fucking head, y'all
(Off the top of his head, y'all)
Oh God! Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
It's a cosmic shame
Thank you
What's it gonna be Kyle?
You have to decide
Tits or destiny?
Tits
Whooooahahaha! Ahhh!!!
WHYYYY GO!!

The government totally sucks, you motherfucker
The government totally sucks

Ben Franklin was a rebel indeed
He liked to get naked while he smoked on the weed
He was a genius, but if he was here today
The government would fuck him up his righteous A!

Now let me tell you somethin' about the government (Uh huh)
They're fuckin' up the environment (Say what?)
They're takin' all the fuckin' beautiful animals (Yeah?)
And making them fuckin' extinct (Oh no!)

The government totally sucks, you motherfucker
The government totally sucks
The government totally sucks

'Cause the land of love and freedom
Is just a baby's breath away
And if we hold hands together
We can bring back the USA
The USA ay-ay, yeah
Bring back the USA ay-yeah
The fuckin' USA ay-yeah
Bring back the US…
Government totally sucks

(That was amazing. You changed people's lives tonight!)
Yeah, it was awesome, compared to bullshit!1
The government totally sucks, you motherfucker
The government totally sucks
Ben Franklin was a rebel indeed, he liked to get naked while he smoked on the weed
He was a genius but, if he was here today, the government would fuck him up his righteous A!
Now let me tell you something about the government (Uh, huh)
They're fucking up the environment (Say what?)
They're taking all thе fucking beautiful animals (Yeah?) And making them fucking еxtinct (Oh, no!)

Government totally sucks

We're a ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness that it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without a tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming home

We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself but the only way is down

We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes then quickly moves away (Moves away)

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain (The pain)

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line, oh yeah


We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself but the only way to go is down

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
DEWEY:
BLLLLP! OK. It starts off... a dark stage, and then a beam of light,and you can see me and my guitar
In the end of time
There was a man
Who knew the road
And the writing
Was written on the stone
And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles. Roadies, that means dry ice. We're gonna talk about this later
In the ancient time
An artist led the way
But no one
Seemed to understand
Chimes, Freddy
In his heart he knew
The artist must be true
But the legend of the rent
Was way past due
And then, Katie, you come in with the bass
Well, you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine
You think you can
Kick me out of the band
And then, Zack, you come in with a face-melter. OK ?
Well, there's just one problem there
The band is mine
How can you kick me out
Of what is mine ?
And then... Hawaii Five-O. You ever see that show ? OK, well, there's a drum solo in it that goes:
You're not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
And I want the backup singers to be like:
Well, you're not hardcore
(No, you're not hardcore)
Unless you live hardc...
(Unless you live hardcore)
But the legend of the rent
Was way hardcore
Boom ! Big old explosion. Some, like, confetti comes down. That's all I got so far. It's a work in progress
SUMMER:
I liked it, Mr. Schneebly. I thought it was really catchy
DEWEY:
Thank you

You can't kill The Metal
The Metal will live on
Punk Rock tried to kill The Metal
But they failed, as they were smite to the ground
New Wave tried to kill The Metal
But they failed, as they were stricken down to the ground
Grunge tried to kill The Metal
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
They failed, as they were thrown to the ground

Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Met-ee-etal-etal, et-ee-etal-etal, et-ee-eh

No one can destroy The Metal
The Metal will strike you down with a vicious blow
We are the vanquished foes of The Metal
We tried to win, for why? We do not know

New Wave tried to destroy The Metal
But The Metal had its way
Grunge then tried to dethrone The Metal
But Metal was in the way
Punk Rock tried to destroy The Metal
But Metal was much too strong
Techno tried to defile The Metal
But Techno was proven wrong
Yeah
Metal
It comes from Hell

The road is fuckin' hard
The road is fuckin' tough-ah
There's no question that-ah
It is rough rough stuff
It's the fuckin' road my friend
But it's the only road I know
When I'm lunchin' on a tasty bush
Right after the show
You g-go go go!

The road is fuckin' hard
It's also really fuckin' tough
There's no question that-ah
It don't take no guff
The road is a b-i-itch, my friend
But it's the only fuckin' road I know
When I'm snackin' on a tasty bush
Right after the show
You g-go go go

I met a tasty baby in Michigan
We screwed two times, then I left
Sometimes I think of my baby in Michigan
Why can't I stay in one place for more than two days
Why?!

Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Road

Damn, a hard day's rockin'\
Better slip off ma shoes
Maybe give a little stretch, and a bend
Dip m'toe to jacuzzi, baby
Slip out this book: The Buttress of Windsor
Ho ho ho, who's this? How's it goin'?

That's the first thin' I say to you
How's it goin'? Are you flowin'?
Listen honey
Thinkin' 'bout a couple things to say to you
Showin', growin'
Man I'd like to place my hand
Upon your fuckin' sexy ass and squeeze
And squeeze

Take off your blouse
And your underpants
Then take a look
'Cause here me and KG come naked
Out of the side-hatch
With the oils and perfume and incense
Now you're groovin'
Put on a cool '70s groove
A funky groove to fuck to
A funky groove to fuck to

Me, me and KG
It's all about sex supreme
We likes to cream jeans
Have you ever been worked on
By two guys who are hot for your snatch?
That's what I'm offerin' you

You step into our room
And then you smell the perfume
You lay upon our roundish bed
And then you feel a tickling on your head
It's KG with the feather and the French tickler
Look out baby he got the tools
And then you feel sumpin' down by your feet
It's me, it's JB, I'm suckin' upon your toes
We don't mind sucking on toes
Good luck finding a boyfriend who sucks toe, ow

Havin' sex with me and KG
Now you're talkin' double team supreme
Let's roll
Oh
Ahh, oh!
What! Yeah! Huh! Nah! Oh!
Ah, that's it, that's right
Ohmygah, oh-I-think-I'm-gonna, Ohh!
Deht! Deht! Eeee!

That was the one

Hail Satan!
 Hail Satan!
 Hail Satan!
 Hail Satan!
They fucked our asses

They fucked our show
But we marched through hill and ill
Through the ice and snow
Ha
They fucked our asses
They fucked 'em hard
But we kept our indie cred
For the whole nine yards
Ha
They blocked our album
They fucked our show
But we marched through hill and ill

Moses came down from the hill
Holding the rules in his hand
Looked all around, suddenly found
No one was listenin' now it's time to throw down

So throw down
Yeah, throw down
Well, throw down
Throw down
Jesus turned water to wine
The star in the sky was a sign
They called him a liar, you're not the Messiah
Get out of the temple now it's time to throw down

So throwdown
Yeah, throw down
Well, throw down

So throw down
Yeah, throw down
Well, throw down
Throw down
All religions of the world today
We've got to leave them alone
We've got to use our fuckin' brains today
Before we're gone, before we're gone
Right now
The three of them fought in the rain
The world was completely insane
Sound the alarms, nuclear bombs
You crazy motherfucker, now it's time to throw down

So throw down
Yeah, throw down
Well, throw down
Throw down

It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
(Not for very much longer)
I've got to keep control

I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And not a step to the right
Put your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

Wеll, I was walking down the street
Just a-having a think
When a snake of a guy gavе me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pickup truck and those devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And not a step to the right
You put your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again
It's just a jump to the left
And not a step to the right
You put your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
It really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again
To be the best, we gotta pass the test
We gotta make it all the way
To the top of the mountain
We can do it again
To feel the high, we got to learn to fly
We got to take it to the sky
On the wings of an eagle
You're the best in the world
You are the best, but you say you don't know
You've got the touch, now come on let it show
You call the shots
But you know that you gots to believe in
The things that you dream in
Your search for new meaning
Is very revealing
The power of being
Is what you are feeling
You gotta believe
That you're simply the best
It could've been disaster til the pupil found his master!

This is the greatest and best song in the world…
…tribute

Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said, “Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul” (Soul)

Well, me and Kyle, we looked at each other
And we each said, “Okay”
And we played the first thing that came to our heads, just so happened to be
The best song in the world, it was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow-ho

Needless to say, the beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail and the beast was done
He asked us *snort* “Be you angels?”
And we said, “Nay, we are but men!” Rock
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh, whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no
No, this is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world, alright
It was the greatest song in the world, alright

The greatest song in the world

Guh fli-goo, ga-goo-buh-dee
Ooh, guh-goo-bee
Ooh-guh-guh-bee-guh-guh-bee
Fli-goo gee-goo
A-fliguh woo-wa mama Lucifer!
And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song

This is just a tribute, you've gotta believe me
And I wish you were there, just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck! Good God, gotta love it
So surprised to find you can't stop it
A fiery ring of fire, rich motherfucker, aw
Alright, alright

This is the greatest song in the world...

PB: You used that green, that thing
KG: This crystal is fucking rad
JB: I'm a little scared of the power of it
KG: Well, we need it though
JB: Yeah. Okay Donald Jr, we're gonna have to uh, we're gonna have to take off now. We're taking the green thing and we're going to save the world. You're a piece of shit and you can go fuck yourself. Good luck surviving here without any of your Nazis or any of your KKK. You fuckin' turd whistle

Rock the house with the UFOs for fun
They didn't come, they didn't harm no one
They got not confined to Area 51
No, rock the house with the UFOs for fun
Fun, fun
How did they get here, from, oh, so far away?
I hear you mumbling, rumbling, stepping, so you say
Have you ever had a wrinkle-in-time?
That's how they do get up!
All you wide-eyed dipshits
Magging all about the UFOs

Are you plugged in? (Yeah)
Alright, you ready?
One-two, a one-two-three

I don't play video games no more, never play video games
'Cept for a little bit of God of War, never play video games
Maybe a once in a while, a little bit of Fallout 4
But that's okay, not right now, I got things to do
'Cause I don't play video games no more, I never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption II, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Trying to live your days with honour and intеgrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all, that's like fuckin' Shakеspeare
Frigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigig

You know I don't play video games no more
Tiny bit of video game
I guess I still play fuckin' video games
Yee-haw

That's it, that's the one
It's on the album

We've been sent, to issue all you people here a warning
I'm not at liberty to say the details of our most peculiar warning
Yeah
Suffice to say, all you people here are in grave danger

So come on!

Through the skies, he flies!
He doesn't know the reason why!
But he flies so high, you know that it's true!
Lot of times, when the elders, they smile
An illusion, an infusion, an intrusion!
An amusement park ride!

Exploding brains, from Alzon to Zanzibar
To the shores of ye old rustic Chinook
Decimating the competition
Leaving in their wake, the blind ambition
Come along children, and rock, get it on

In whatever heinous realm that it squats
In whatever heinous realm that it squats
In whatever heinous realm that it squats
That it squats, that it squats, that it squats

High above the mucky-muck, castle made of clouds
There sits Wonderboy sitting oh so proudly
Not much to say when you're high above the mucky-muck
Yeah, yeah

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power?
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck, man

Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman
Arch-rival and nemesis of Wonderboy
With powers comparable to Wonderboy
What powers you ask?
I don't know, how about the power of flight
That do anything for ya?
That's levitation, holmes
How about the power to kill a yak
From 200 yards away
With mind-bullets!
That's telekinesis, Kyle
How about the power
To move you

History of Wonderboy and Young Nastyman
Rigga-goo-goo, riggah-goo-goo
A secret to be told, a gold chest to be bold
And blasting forth with three-part harmony
Yeow!

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power?
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck, man

Well Wonderboy and Young Nastyman joined forces
They formed a band the likes of which had never been seen
And they called themselves Tenacious D
That's right

Me and KG (That's me)
We're now Tenacious D
Come fly with me, fly

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power?
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck, man

Oh, take my hand
Young Nastyman, and we'll fly
Bring out your broadsword, there's the Hydra
Slice his throat and grab his scrot'
You take the high road, I'll take the low
There, the crevasse, fill it with your mighty juice

With karate I'll kick your ass
Here to Tienanmen Square
Oh yeah motherfucker
I'm gonna kick your fucking derriere
Yeah, yeah

You broke the rules
Now I pull out all your pubic hair
You motherfucker
You motherfucker

Kyle betrayed me
And then he lied
Tried to hide
And I died deep inside
And you know the reason why

I'm gonna kick your ass
From here
To right over there
Oh yeah motherfucker
I'm gonna kick your fucking derriere
Yeah, yeah

You broke the rules
Now I pull out all your pubic hair
You motherfucker
You motherfucker

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
But in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Monday morning, hit the sack
What the fuck, ya lickin' my crack
Yellow belly gone, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, no where
Nowhere to go, ah-yah
Ah-yah
Rock, roll, rock and roll
One sweet dream
Pick up the sack, get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true... today
Came true... today
Came true... today... yes it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
One for all
T-ka, T-ka, T-ka, T-ka, t-k-ta-ka-ka-ka-ka
Oh yeah, alright
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

Oh shit, Oh shit
Oh shit, Oh shit
Oh shit, Oh shit
Oh no no no no no oh shit (Oh shit, Oh shit)

Skit, skat and a motherfuckin' skit skat, fuckin' skat
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
